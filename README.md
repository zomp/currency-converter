## To Do

Out of scope of the assignment, but necessary to implement before going to production:
* Testing – a proper one, here only the scaffolding is implemented.
* CI/CD – the phases after the code gets pushed into the git repository.
* Accessibility – to let everyone use the app.
* Minification – remove the unused libraries and reduce the size of the residual code.
* Input validation – invalid data on model and web service interfaces (future dates...).
* Error handling – web service errors should be handled properly.
* Review – I used Angular too long ago and a feedback would move the app forward a lot.
